<b>Web application for Renting apartments</b>

Tech stack for application is Java Spring boot with Spring Security on backend and ReactJS on frontend. For storing data I used MySQL Database management system.

Application fully supports Authentication and Authorization.

There are 3 roles in this application: Admin, Renter, Client.

The Plan is also to add some map related features with Leaflet in the near future.
